# Startup config file for Microchip RN2483 join TTN in otaa
# commands prefixed by ! or $ are executed by ESP all others passed to serial module (RN2483)
# command starting with $ wait until device return \n 
# RN2483 always return string followed by "\r\n" on each command (ex "ok\r\n")
# so $ wait a response (good or not) before sending next command
# !delay or any $ are not executed when connected via browser web terminal (websocket)
# See schematics here https://github.com/hallard/WeMos-RN2483

# Your device should have been registered on TTN before using, here is how to
# On the RN2483, use `sys get hweui` and `mac get deveui` 
# you then get the devices hweui & deveui, They are probably the same
# then register device on TTN console dashboard

# Then you must setup your keys (obtained from TTN console dashboard)
# Personnaly I prefer setup the 3 fixed values in TTN dashboard
# then put them into the RN2483 module 

# then on RN2483 device (1st setup, then don't need to be set again)
# $mac set appeui YOUR_APP_EUI
# $mac set appkey YOUR_APP_KEY
# $mac set deveui YOUR_DEV_EUI
# and saved with `mac save`
# $mac save

# Then Join TTN Network
$mac join otaa
